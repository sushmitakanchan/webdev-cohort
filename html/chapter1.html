    <!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language â€” it's the basic building block of all websites.
    Think of it like the skeleton of a web page. It tells the browser:
    - what things are (like a heading, a paragraph, an image)
    -how to organize them
    -and sometimes where to find them (like links or images) -->
    <p>This is a juice shop.</p>
